# Work Day Scheduler

## Purpose
* GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule

* WHEN I open the planner, THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar

* WHEN I scroll down, THEN I am presented with time blocks for standard business hours

* WHEN I view the time blocks for that day, THEN each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the * past, present, or future

* WHEN I click into a time block, THEN I can enter an event

* WHEN I click the save button for that time block, THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage

* WHEN I refresh the page, THEN the saved events persist

## Built With
* JQuery / Javascript
* HTML
* CSS
